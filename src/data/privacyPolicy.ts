Effective Date: November 30, 2025

Quran Notification App ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** collect any user data, personal information, or device information. The App does not require you to create an account or provide any personal details. Your privacy is our priority, and we operate with a zero-data-collection policy.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any user data or information, we do not use, store, or process any personal information. The App is designed to function independently without requiring data collection.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** collect, share, sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any user information to outside parties. Your data remains completely private and local to your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising services, or data tracking tools. We do not integrate with any external services that collect user data.

## 5. Data Security

Since we collect no personal data, there is no user information to secure. However, we ensure the App operates securely on your device without compromising your privacy.

## 6. Children's Privacy

This App is dedicated to users of all ages, including children under 13. We do **not** collect any data from children or any users. There are no age restrictions on using this App, and parents can feel confident that their children's information is completely protected.

## 7. Notification Permissions

The App requests permission to send notifications for delivering Quranic verses and reminders based on your mood preferences. This permission is used only locally on your device and no notification data is shared with third parties.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the App. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
